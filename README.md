# Atari Breakout OpenGL

---

## Overview

This is a simple clone of the popular game Atari Breakout, made in C++ and OpenGL. It is my first project in OpenGL, and I learned key fundamentals in C++ and OpenGL when making this. It uses GLFW, GLAD, GLM, and STB Image for image loading.

Lots of the textures are from https://learnopengl.com and some references are from there too, so check it out if you haven't.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Naksh-Rathore/atari-breakout-opengl.git/`
2. Change directory into the repository with `cd atari-breakout-opengl`
3. Change the GLFW and GLAD file paths in the Makefile to your own. (Will put them in the project another time)
4. Build the project with `make`
5. Run the project with `./main` and play!
